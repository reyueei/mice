====

"mice" is a distribution transformer monitoring web-based application.

It provides a real-time monitoring of the conditions of every transformer in local areas. Each devices represented as a node
are interconnected with one another in a SWAP-based network protocol. Furthermore, this project features a Geographical Information
System that provides the exact locations of each node in the system to track the transformer if any faults occur.
